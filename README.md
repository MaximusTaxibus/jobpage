# jobpage
This little project serves as a place to share my CV with potential employers as well as providing me with a space to experiment with my newly acquired computer skills 
I started this page to practice my HTML5/CSS skills and as I go along I want to include new features I learn on the way.
Programming is a learning by doing type of thing so this is what I would like to do with it!
